This is a small I collaborated with 3 other students to create a simple web application where user can register and login to use the app. The user can also create, edit, delete, read their posts and the others'. Users can also post images, like and unlike each other post.

## Front-end

- React and Redux.
- Bootstrap and Sass.
- Formik to handle forms.

## Back-end

This simple app is not totally responsive yet.
